// Per-client feature flags for the Client Portal.
//
// Each client row carries a `feature_flags` jsonb map (added in
// migration 0053). Empty map (the default for every existing row)
// means "behave like every other client" — no opt-in, no surprises.
//
// =====================================================================
// THE RULE — read this before adding any new feature
// =====================================================================
//
// Real clients (SERHANT., 54 Realty, Douglas Elliman, etc.) must NEVER
// see an in-progress feature until it is explicitly rolled out to them.
// The only client allowed to see in-progress features is OpsLabs (slug
// "opslabs"), the test portal.
//
// To honour the rule, EVERY new feature ships in two halves:
//
//   1. Wrap the NEW code path in `clientHasFeature(client, "X")`:
//        if (clientHasFeature(client, "reports_tab")) {
//          // new behaviour, only OpsLabs sees this
//        } else {
//          // existing behaviour — what real clients keep seeing
//        }
//
//   2. After the code deploys, flip the flag on for OpsLabs only:
//        update clients
//        set feature_flags = jsonb_set(feature_flags, '{reports_tab}', 'true')
//        where slug = 'opslabs';
//
//      No other client row is touched, so `clientHasFeature(realClient,
//      "reports_tab")` returns false for them and they continue to render
//      the existing path — bit-identical to before the deploy.
//
// When the user gives the explicit "roll out reports_tab to everyone"
// approval, there are two ways to lift the gate:
//   • One-shot SQL — turn the flag on for every client row.
//   • Better: delete the `clientHasFeature` check and the old code path,
//     leave the new path as the default. Cleaner long-term; the flag
//     entry on OpsLabs becomes dead data and can stay or get cleaned.
//
// NEVER invert the check (`if (!clientHasFeature(...))`). That makes the
// new behaviour the default for everyone and the flag would have to be
// flipped on OpsLabs to HIDE the new feature — which is the exact
// opposite of the safety contract. The wrong-by-construction shape
// reads `if (clientHasFeature(...))` every time.
//
// =====================================================================
// What CAN'T be feature-flagged
// =====================================================================
//
// Some changes don't pass through `clientHasFeature` and therefore can't
// be gated this way:
//   • Schema migrations (a new column or enum value lands for every
//     client at once). Keep migrations additive + non-destructive; the
//     code that USES the new schema is still flag-able.
//   • Global CSS / theme tokens / portal shell layout edits that affect
//     all clients in one shot.
//   • API route hardening / outbound integration changes that don't
//     differentiate per client.
// For those, the safety story is "the migration is non-destructive and
// the existing behaviour keeps working even with the new column
// present" — not feature flags.
//
// =====================================================================
// Defensive read
// =====================================================================
//
// Flags are loaded server-side by resolvePortalClient (see
// lib/portals/token.ts) and ride along on PortalClient. That loader
// uses a defensive two-query pattern so pre-migration deploys still
// resolve clients cleanly (flags read as empty {}). Result: a
// deploy-before-migration accident downgrades to "nobody has any flags
// enabled" rather than 404-ing every portal. clientHasFeature() also
// returns false for any malformed flags blob, so a corrupted jsonb is a
// quiet no-op, not a crash.

import type { PortalClient } from "@/lib/portals/token";

// Returns true when the supplied flag is truthy in the client's
// feature_flags map. Anything missing, undefined, or non-truthy
// (false, 0, empty string, null) returns false — opt-in semantics.
//
// Accepts a partial shape so callers in test / staff drilldown
// contexts (where they may have only loaded part of the client row)
// can pass whatever they have without TypeScript gymnastics.
